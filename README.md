<p>To get the needed bukkit versions download the spigot buildtools and run the appropriate commands for the versions listed in the pom file.</p>
<p>e.g. "java -jar BuildTools.jar --rev 1.10.2" (Enter this into git bash)</p>

<p>If you make a reasonable contribution to a file feel free to add yourself into the @author section of the docs on that file. Otherwise git generally will track who has contributed what which covers small changes.</p>
<p>If fixes or new code is made please include reasonably detailed notes on what has changed for easier checking. Also don't create extra features that should be addons such as vault support. The purpose of this mod is to be light weight. If there are common features we can make a listing of addons supporting these features. The only extra features will be like bungee location support as it is such an important feature on networks.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> I may have some slightly different code styles to usual. I am self taught and the main purpose of this plugin is to be efficient and create an easy to use API to hook into and change and/or add support for new features. If there is anything you feel, know or just have a suggestion about parts of code or the style for some files feel free to message me or open an issue as I am always looking to improve myself and also try to make the best possible tools I can for the community.</p>

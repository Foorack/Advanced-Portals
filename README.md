<p>If you make a reasonable contribution to a file feel free to add yourself into the @author section of the docs on that file. Otherwise git generally will track who has contributed what which covers small changes.</p>
<p>If fixes or new code is made please include reasonably detailed notes on what has changed for easier checking. Also don't create extra features that should be addons such as vault support. The purpose of this mod is to be light weight. If there are common features we can make a listing of addons supporting these features. The only extra features will be like bungee location support as it is such an important feature on networks.</p>

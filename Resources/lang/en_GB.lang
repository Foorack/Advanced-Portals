# Same as default minecraft lang files but can handle comments.
# Anything not set in translations will be defaulted back to the en_GB file.
# I suggest if you want to change text in english either make a new called en_US
# or en_GB2 so when updates come out new text can still default back to the old files.
#
# TODO check if the files are loaded from the config folder and if not how it does it in bukkit.

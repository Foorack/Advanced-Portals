# Same as default minecraft lang files but can handle comments if a # is the first character
# Anything not set in translations will be defaulted back to the en_GB file.
# I suggest if you want to change text in english either make a new called en_US
# or en_GB2 so when updates come out new text can still default back to the old files.
#
# The format of included strings is %(number of argument)$s
# So the order of variables being inserted into the string is not a set order. Just like minecraft
#
# For colors use \u00A or ยง (can be entered by holding alt and pressing 2 then 1 on the numpad)

#
# TODO check if the files are loaded from the config folder and if not how it does it in bukkit.

Note: If anyone has a better solution for licenses please contact me. I want to
make it so if there are major edits you can redistribute but you can't just re-upload
the code somewhere else as I have had my projects stolen before.

The plugin comes with no warranty of any kind. In no event shall I liable for
any claim, damages or other liability. (Not that it will ever come to that)

Permission is granted, free of charge to modify and use the plugin however
you please. However you will not be allowed to sell the plugin or any modified
versions of it.

All modified public and non public copies may credit me as the origional author
any you must specify that it is a modified version.

In terms of server use, you can make money on servers using the plugin (not sure
if that needs to be specified) and you may modify the functionality as much or
as little as you want.

All modifications of this plugin must follow the same license.

To redistribute modified versions of the plugin, you must make significant
changes to the functionality of the plugin. For example fixing a small
bug would not be deemed significant or changing the name of a command.

Private modifications do not have to follow any rules with how large or small
the modifications have to be but please do not try to pretend that you made the base yourself.
Some sort of credit would be appreciated but is not neccesary :)

SUMMARY
1. You can modify
2. You cannot sell any form of this plugin
3. You may redistribute the plugin as long as significant
     changes to the functionality have been made.
4. The license may be changed. However it will mostly be to cover details
     that I forgot to specify.
